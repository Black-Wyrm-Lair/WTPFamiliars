# Introduction
This mod introduces an alternative version of the standard Find Familiar spell, opting for a more PnP faithful representation of it.  The player will also be able to choose from a pool of three or four creatures
(exception: True Neutral mages are restricted to the True Neutral Familiar) instead of being assigned a Familiar based upon alignment.

When the spell is cast you will be able to select the Familiar matching your own alignment or one of the Familiars whose alignment is closest to your own.
For example, if your alignment is Lawful Evil you would have a choice between the Imp (LE), the Dust Mephit (NE) and the Ferret (LN).

The Familiars have now extended dialogue and new icon colors. They will make themselves heard when they feel they've spent too much time in the backpack and their dead has now different consequences for the player:
failing the constitution based system shock check (see table under) will render the mage temporarily vulnerable to enemy attacks. Afterwards, a 3 days period of mourning will prevent the summon of a new Familiar.
During this period, the mage suffers a -1 penalty to their constitution. When the mourning is over, the mage will regain the lost constitution point and will be able to summon a new Familiar.

The mod also introduces a new Familiar (spider) in order to have each alignment represented by a different creature.  The spider has been placed in the True Neutral slot and as such minimum bumping has occurred with regard to which Familiar is assigned to which alignment.  

# Compatibility

This mod is designed to work with Baldur's Gate II: Shadows of Amn with the Throne of Bhaal expansion pack and has been completely overhauled with full Baldur's Gate Trilogy compatibility in mind.
It also supports Baldur's Gate II: Enhanced Edition, Enhanced Edition Trilogy, and has experimental support for Icewind Dale: Enhanced Edition.

Install this modification after Spell Revisions or any other modification that changes the Find Familiar spell in any way.
